      <h2>Come to Know Him.</h2>
      <p class="mainp">Do you desire to know God? Are you questioning how you can come to Him and really know that you have a relationship with Him?
        You want to know that He will always be with you, even in death you will be safe in His arms.  You will spend eternity with Him in Heaven. You desire 
        to come to Him now. You can come to Him now! There is one way to come to the one true God. John 14:6 New American Standard Bible states Jesus said to him,
        “I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.” You cannot come to God by being a good person or by trying to earn
        your salvation by good works. Ephesians 2:8-9 New Living Translation 8 God saved you by his grace when you believed. And you can’t take credit for this; it is a 
        gift from God. 9 Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done, so none of us can boast about it. The way to come to God is through Jesus Christ.
        We have all sinned, disobeyed God and His Law, the 10 Commandments. Sin separates us from a holy God. We need a Savior to cover our sins and reconcile us to God. 
        Romans 5:6-8 New American Standard Bible: For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. For one will hardly die for a righteous
        person, though perhaps for the good person someone would even dare to die. But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ 
        died for us.”God loves you so much that he sent us a Savior. Romans 6:23 New Living Translation 23 For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal 
        life through Christ Jesus our Lord. John 3:16-17 New American Standard Bible “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in
        Him will not perish, but have eternal life. For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but so that the world might be saved through Him.Romans 
        10:9-13 the New Living Translation tells us “ If you openly declare that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 
        10 For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by openly declaring your faith that you are saved. 11 As the Scriptures tell us, 
        “Anyone who trusts in him will never be disgraced.”12 Jew and Gentile are the same in this respect. They have the same Lord, who gives generously to all who call on him. 
        13 For “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”So right now while you’re being drawn to come to God, speak out in prayer and let’s repent and turn 
        from sin, believe in the sacrifice Jesus Christ paid, call out to Jesus Christ for salvation, confess Jesus as Lord and come to God. Dear Heavenly Father, I have 
        sinned and disobeyed you. I want to become your child and have eternal life. I believe Jesus Christ died to pay the price for my sin, that Jesus rose from the dead
        and is Lord, I want Jesus Christ to be Lord in my life, save me Lord. Amen
